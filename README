luafcgid - a statefull FastCGI daemon for Lua

---
SUMMARY
---

luafcgid is a multithreaded FastCGI server that runs under BSD/Linux/MacOSX and
Windows (using MinGW and pthreads32). It manages a number of independent, 
persistent Lua states, that are then loaded with Lua scripts from the file 
system. These scripts are loaded/initialized on demand, and held in memory for 
as long as possible. The Lua scripts are also allowed to interface with the 
FastCGI libraries: thus providing an extremely fast, streamlined and 
lightwieght platform from which to develop web-centric apps in Lua.


All development testing is done with the following server platform:

-= luafcgid reference platform =-

Hardware:

Pentium 4 3+ Ghz
Intel MB chipset
Intel Pro+ 1GB Ethernet
2GB RAM

Software:

FreeBSD - last stable release
nginx web server - last stable release
Lua - last stable release
libthr - drop-in replacement for libpthread


** NOTE: Further testing may be done on other platforms when available. Volunteers welcome. **
