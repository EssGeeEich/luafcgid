luafcgid - a statefull FastCGI daemon for Lua

---
SUMMARY
---

luafcgid is a multithreaded FastCGI server that runs under BSD/Linux/MacOSX and
Windows (using MinGW and pthreads32). It manages a number of independent, 
persistent Lua states, that are then loaded with Lua scripts from the file 
system. These scripts are loaded/initialized on demand, and held in memory for 
as long as possible. The Lua scripts are also allowed to interface with the 
FastCGI libraries: thus providing an extremely fast, streamlined and 
lightweight platform from which to develop web-centric apps in Lua.


All development testing is done with the following server platform:

-= luafcgid reference platform =-

Hardware:

Pentium 4 3+ Ghz
Intel MB chipset
Intel Pro+ 1GB Ethernet
2GB RAM

Software:

FreeBSD - last stable release
nginx web server - last stable release
Lua - last stable release
libthr - drop-in replacement for libpthread


** NOTE: Further testing may be done on other platforms when available. 
** Volunteers welcome.

DESIGN

The basic design of luafcgid is currently based off of the "threaded.c" example 
provided in the official FactCGI devkit. This is where each worker thread 
contains an isolated blocking accept loop. By adding a very small amount of
random delay in each loop, various 'harmonics' are avoided and the load is
spread evenly across the thread pool - without any complicated overhead
introduced by a master accept loop. The FastCGI libraries also provide a 
connect queue for each worker thread so that transient load spikes can be 
handled with a minimum of fuss.

 +------------------+  |   +---------------+  |            |  Lua state  |
                       +-->| worker thread |--+            +-------------+
                           +---------------+
		
Lua is then introduced into the picture by created a shared Lua state for each 
Lua script that is requested. This setup is inspired by the 'mod_wombat' 
project. A state is initialized and loaded with the script, and is kept 
active for as long as possible. This allows for persistence across HTTP 
requests. There is a configurable limit to the total number of Lua states
that luafcgid will maintain. When this limit is reached, popularity and aging
are used to decide which states to flush and reload with a new script.

PERFORMANCE
---

Preliminary testing (with 10 worker threads) indicates that this may be a
workable design...

test script:
---
s = "Hello Word"

function handler()
	return s
end
